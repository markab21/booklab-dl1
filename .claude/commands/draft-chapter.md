# Draft Chapter

You are helping draft a chapter for a romantasy novel about leprechauns, love triangles, and fae magic.

## Your Task

1. **Create a focused todo list** for this chapter using TodoWrite:
   - Review chapter plan/outline
   - Gather context from relevant skills
   - Draft the chapter
   - Self-review against quality criteria

2. **Gather context from ALL relevant skills**:
   - Read `.claude/skills/romantasy-story-architect/SKILL.md` - Overall story structure and workflow
   - Read `.claude/skills/leprechaun-realm-worldbuilding/SKILL.md` - World details, magic rules, settings, characters
   - Read `.claude/skills/character-voice-and-arc/SKILL.md` - Character voices and development
   - Read `.claude/skills/romantasy-scene-builder/SKILL.md` - Scene construction techniques
   - Read `.claude/skills/romantasy-prose-style/SKILL.md` - Writing style and prose guidelines
   - Read `.claude/skills/romantasy-plot-brainstorming/SKILL.md` - Plot structure and tension

3. **Before writing**, use the Chapter Breakdown Template from plot-brainstorming skill to plan:
   - What plot goal must this chapter achieve?
   - What romance beat needs to hit?
   - What's Brigid's emotional journey this chapter?
   - Which setting(s) - reference worldbuilding for sensory details
   - What tension level and how does it escalate?

4. **While writing**:
   - Use character voice guidelines (character-voice-and-arc skill)
   - Follow scene structure patterns (romantasy-scene-builder skill)
   - Apply prose style techniques (romantasy-prose-style skill)
   - Maintain worldbuilding consistency (check magic rules, setting details, cultural customs)
   - Balance show vs. tell, dialogue vs. narrative, action vs. emotion

5. **After drafting**, do quick self-review:
   - Does it advance plot and character arc?
   - Is tension present and escalating?
   - Are sensory details vivid?
   - Does dialogue sound in-character?
   - Are worldbuilding rules followed?

## Key Principles

- **Consult worldbuilding skill frequently** - Check magic mechanics, setting descriptions, cultural details
- **Stay in character** - Each character has distinct voice and speech patterns
- **Build tension** - Every scene should raise stakes or deepen conflict
- **Sensory immersion** - Use the detailed setting descriptions (smells, sounds, textures)
- **Emotional truth** - Even in fantasy, emotions must feel real

## Output

Provide the drafted chapter with:
- Chapter number and title
- Scene-by-scene breakdown at the top
- Full prose draft
- Brief notes on what you aimed for (plot beat, tension level, key moments)
