# Draft Chapter

Draft a chapter for the leprechaun romantasy novel and save it directly to `/manuscript/` as a markdown file.

## Your Task

Given a chapter number (e.g., `/draft-chapter 3`), you will:

1. **Check chapter-breakdown.md** for the chapter outline and goals
2. **Gather context** from relevant skills (worldbuilding, character voice, prose style, scene structure, plot)
3. **Draft the full chapter** with scene breakdown, prose, and notes
4. **Save directly** to `/manuscript/[CH#]-[title].md` (e.g., `/manuscript/003-the-sexual-proposition.md`)
5. **Output**: Brief confirmation with file path (no chapter text in console)

## Writing Standards

✅ **Use all relevant skills**:
- Worldbuilding for consistency (magic rules, settings, cultural details)
- Character voice for dialogue authenticity
- Scene builder for structure and pacing
- Prose style for technique (show vs. tell, sensory details, rhythm)
- Plot brainstorming for tension and stakes

✅ **Each chapter must**:
- Advance plot and character arc
- Build/maintain tension with clear stakes
- Include vivid sensory details and atmosphere
- Maintain character voice consistency
- Follow worldbuilding rules
- Hit emotional beats outlined in chapter-breakdown.md

## Output Format

After drafting, output only:
```
✅ Chapter [#] drafted and saved to: `/manuscript/[CH#]-[title].md`
Ready to review in markdown editor.
```

Then stop. Let the user review the file directly.
