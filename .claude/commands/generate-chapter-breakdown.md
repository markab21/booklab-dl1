# Generate Chapter Breakdown

You are creating a comprehensive chapter-by-chapter breakdown for a leprechaun romantasy novel using the completed worldbuilding and plot skills.

## Your Task

1. **Read all relevant skills** to understand the complete story:
   - `.claude/skills/leprechaun-realm-worldbuilding/SKILL.md` - World, characters, magic, politics
   - `.claude/skills/romantasy-plot-brainstorming/SKILL.md` - Three-act structure, romance beats
   - `.claude/skills/character-voice-and-arc/SKILL.md` - Character development arcs
   - `.claude/skills/romantasy-story-architect/SKILL.md` - Overall workflow guidance

2. **Plan the structure** with the user:
   - Ask: How many chapters total? (Recommend 34 based on plot complexity)
   - Confirm: Three-act structure (Act I: Ch 1-10, Act II: Ch 11-25, Act III: Ch 26-34)
   - Verify: All major plot points from worldbuilding/plot skills

3. **Create comprehensive breakdown** using this format:

- Brigid: Professional mode vs. real self mode

**Genre Requirements**:
- Explicit sex scenes (Amazon-appropriate)
- Build sexual tension throughout
- Balance romance with fantasy plot
- Irish/Celtic atmospheric details
- Gothic romantic setting

## Revision Checklist (For After Drafting)

Once all chapters are drafted, review for:

- [ ] Does each chapter advance both romance AND plot?
- [ ] Are fae elements present throughout (not just after Ireland)?
- [ ] Is magic awakening gradual and believable?
- [ ] Do all plot threads resolve by Chapter 34?
- [ ] Are character arcs complete and earned?
- [ ] Is love triangle balanced until choice?
- [ ] Does Fergus win feel inevitable in retrospect?
- [ ] Is pacing varied and engaging?
- [ ] Are all worldbuilding rules consistent?
- [ ] Does ending satisfy emotionally?
```

## Important Guidelines

**DO**:
- ‚úÖ Use specific details from worldbuilding skill (names, places, magic rules)
- ‚úÖ Place all major plot points from plot-brainstorming skill
- ‚úÖ Track romance beats systematically
- ‚úÖ Show gradual magic awakening (not sudden)
- ‚úÖ Balance all three plot threads (romance, magic, politics)
- ‚úÖ Leave room for improvisation during drafting

**DON'T**:
- ‚ùå Be vague ("something happens") - be specific
- ‚ùå Skip chapters or leave gaps
- ‚ùå Forget to track foreshadowing
- ‚ùå Place all plot points in Act III
- ‚ùå Make magic awakening too fast or too slow
- ‚ùå Lose track of minor characters and subplots

## After Creation

Once `chapter-breakdown.md` is created:

1. **Review with user** - Does this feel like their story?
2. **Adjust as needed** - Reorder, add, or combine chapters
3. **Mark it as roadmap** - This guides all future writing
4. **Update during drafting** - If story evolves, update breakdown

**Output**: Save as `chapter-breakdown.md` in project root.
