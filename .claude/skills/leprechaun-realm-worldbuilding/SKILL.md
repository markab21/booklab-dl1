## Core Story Elements

### The Leprechaun Realm Rules
- **Succession Law**: Fae magic determines the rightful heir - bloodline, magical power, and ability to secure fae alliance all factor in
- **Noble Houses**: Multiple fae noble houses form a council that oversees the realm
  - Each house has representation and influence
  - They collectively decide succession when throne is challenged or vacant
- **Current Conflict**:
  - Fergus's father was the head of the council until his untimely death (magical reason)
  - This triggered the succession crisis - throne became open for grabs
  - Fergus has been managing the realm/throne while Conall was away in NYC
  - Conall (older, established power in NYC) vs. Fergus (younger, more connected to ancient magic and the land)
  - Both have legitimate claims, but neither can rule without fae alliance
  - Brigid's fae heritage and awakened power become the deciding factor
- **Why the Marriage Matters**:
  - A fae consort (or ally) with awakened power legitimizes and strengthens the ruler's claim
  - Conall believes he can manipulate Brigid into using her power for him
  - Fergus and Brigid's genuine connection means her power naturally flows to support him
  - Whichever brother has Brigid's genuine magic supporting him wins the throne
- **The Vault**:
  - Brigid's magical power unlocks an ancient vault
  - **Inside the Vault**:
    - **A Binding Spell**: Ancient magic that binds the true ruler's fate
    - **A Prophecy**: Prophecy about Fergus and Brigid specifically
      - Foretells their union and combined power
      - Requires them to marry/pledge themselves to seal their combined magical force
      - Marriage seals Fergus as true heir and legitimizes Brigid as his fae consort
    - **Genealogy Records**: Proof that Brigid is actually royalty/noble blood
      - Records show her mother was of the leprechaun realm
      - Her mother was thought lost in the land of humans (Brigid was born of human father + fae mother)
      - This explains Brigid's powerful fae heritage and why her magic is so potent
      - She's not just a human with dormant fae blood - she's half-fae royalty
  - **The Prophecy's Requirement**:
    - Fergus and Brigid must choose to marry/bind themselves
    - Their combined power must seal the binding
    - This brings luck back to the leprechaun realm (which has been weakened since Fergus's father's death)
    - Their union literally heals/restores the realm's magic

### Leprechaun Nature & Abilities
- **Physical Appearance**:
  - NOT classic tiny men/women
  - Appear the same in real world as in fae world
  - Sexy, powerful fae beings - tall, striking, magnetic
  - Beautiful and dangerous
  - Conall: dark, lean, sharp-featured, intense
  - Fergus: tall, muscular, red-haired, wild and raw
- **Core Magical Abilities**:
  - **Connection to Nature**: Influence over land, plants, animals, weather; attuned to natural cycles
  - **Longevity**: Extended lifespans (centuries), slowed aging
  - **Time Magic**: Subtle manipulation of time perception, extended moments, accelerated healing within magical spaces
  - **Wealth/Gold Connection**: Innate connection to precious metals and resources (Conall's business success)
  - **Glamour**: Can mask appearance/presence to humans, though less needed if not hiding true form
  - **Luck**: Subtle probability manipulation

### The Irish Estate
- **Location**: West Cork, Ireland
- **Estate Name**: Gleann Sc√°th (Shadow Glen)
- **Physical Description**:
  - Ancient stone manor with modern renovations
  - Hidden entrances to the leprechaun realm
  - Gardens with magical properties
  - [Specific rooms: library, ballroom, etc.]
  - Surrounded by dark forests and ancient valleys
  - Remote, isolated location - veil between worlds feels thin
- **Atmosphere**: Misty, mysterious, sensual, ancient magic humming beneath modern surface
- **Weather**: Frequent mist and rain, dramatic sky changes, wild and untamed landscape

### The Uncle (Boss Character)
- **Name**: Conall (means "strong wolf" - predatory, commanding)
- **Age**: Early to mid-40s (noticeably older, established power)
- **Appearance**:
  - Dashing and handsome in a hard, severe way
  - Dark hair (likely dark brown/black to contrast with Fergus's red)
  - Sharp, angular features - striking rather than warm
  - Impeccably tailored suits, expensive watches, polished
  - Fit but lean, controlled physicality
  - Cold, calculating eyes
- **Personality**:
  - Controlled, commanding, strategic
  - Hard and cold in his affections - not genuinely warm
  - Overly and sometimes inappropriately sexual toward Brigid
  - Makes her uncomfortable but also (artificially) turned on
  - Appears protective but it's possessive/manipulative
  - Becomes desperate and dangerous when losing control
- **The Amulet**:
  - Wears a special amulet that magically makes women desire him
  - This explains Brigid's conflicted attraction - it's not real, it's coerced
  - She feels uncomfortable but can't fully understand why she's drawn to him
  - When she discovers the amulet, it reframes everything
- **Important**: Brigid never does anything physical/sexual with him
- **NYC Business**: Private Banking for Ultra-High-Net-Worth Individuals
  - Manages fortunes for billionaires and old money families
  - His extreme intelligence: brilliant financial strategies, always makes winning moves
  - His luck magic: markets swing favorably when he advises, compound success
  - His wealth connection: controls vast amounts of money and resources
  - Control of money = control of powerful people
  - Uses clients' dependence to build his network and leverage
- **Why He Needs to Marry Her**:
  - Knows about her fae heritage and dormant power
  - Believes her awakened magic will give him the fae alliance needed to rule
  - Plans to use her power to manipulate the leprechaun court
  - Supported by old money/older fae wanting to maintain status quo
- **His Claim to Rule**: Established authority, modern wealth/power, legitimate older lineage
- **Climax & Downfall**:
  - When Brigid's power unlocks the vault and Fergus is revealed as true heir, Conall becomes desperate
  - Attempts to kill Brigid ("If I can't have her, nobody can") - she represents his last chance
  - Fergus and Brigid defeat him in battle
  - **His Imprisonment**:
    - Magically bound/imprisoned in an impressive enchanted location (prison that cannot be escaped except by powerful magic or outside intervention)
    - Not dead - alive but contained, his power suppressed
    - His NYC banking empire crumbles without him
    - Seems like a true ending to his threat
  - **Setup for Future Books**:
    - A beautiful leprechaun woman (Fergus's ex) who thought she would become queen through Fergus
    - She's angry and betrayed that Fergus chose Brigid instead
    - She discovers Conall's imprisonment and is sympathetic to his plight
    - She eventually frees him (or provides means to escape) - setting up his return as antagonist
    - Her motivations: vengeance against Fergus/Brigid, or belief that Conall is better for the realm?
    - This becomes the setup for Book 2

### The Nephew (Dirty Leprechaun)
- **Name**: Fergus (means "man of vigor" - ancient warrior name)
- **Age**: Mid-30s (younger than Conall but mature enough to have run the estate)
- **Appearance**:
  - Tall and physically imposing (subverts traditional leprechaun expectations)
  - Red/ginger hair, worn longer and unkempt
  - Scruffy beard, often several days of stubble
  - Rough, bar-fighter aesthetic - lived-in leather jacket, work boots, worn jeans
  - Calloused hands from working the land/magic
  - Green or hazel eyes with mischief and danger
  - Built like a brawler - broad shoulders, muscular from physical labor
  - Often covered in dirt, moss, or evidence of being outdoors

  - He's offended/insulted by her reaction to his ancient name
  - They have an immediate tiff - sparks fly (anger masking attraction)
  - She doesn't know he's the nephew/rival claimant at this point
  - First impression: thinks he's just a local, rough around the edges, but undeniably magnetic
- **His Claim to Rule**:
  - Has been the stand-in leader while Conall was away in NYC
  - Deeply connected to the ancient, wild magic and fae folk
  - Knows the land and the realm intimately through hands-on management
  - Can clean up, present himself in court, and hold his own in political discussions
  - Conall represents "modern" leprechaun power (wealth, NYC business, manipulation)
  - Fergus represents the "old ways" - true fae connection, authentic magic, genuine care for the realm
  - Represents revitalization and authentic leadership, not manipulation
- **Connection to Protagonist**:
  - They meet by happenstance multiple times

## Magic System Rules

### What Humans Can See (Brigid's Awakening)
- **Initially**: Nothing unusual, just an Irish estate
- **Early progression**: Odd occurrences she dismisses - fae folk appearing briefly, strange sounds, unexplained warmth
- **Mid-book**: Increasingly undeniable magical events - small fae creatures visiting her, emotional resonance with Fergus, nature responding to her presence
- **The Reveal**: Forest scene where Fergus shifts into fae form and pulls her into the fae realm
  - She sees the leprechaun realm overlaid with the human world
  - The dual nature of Gleann Sc√°th becomes visible
  - Everything suddenly makes sense
- **Full Access**: Once in the fae realm, she can see and interact with fae world fully

### Magical Consequences
- Breaking leprechaun law: [Consequences? - Your input]
- Human-fae relationships: Rare but possible, particularly when fae blood is involved
- The Marriage Bond: Creates a magical link, especially if fae heritage is awakened
- The Succession Bond: Her power binding to Fergus will have realm-wide implications

### Realm Politics & Court Structure
- **The Court**: [Structure TBD - Council of elders? Noble houses?]
- **The Factions**:
  - **Conall's Supporters**: Old money, older fae who want to maintain current power structure and wealth
  - **Fergus's Supporters**: Younger generation, those wanting reform and authentic connection to the old magic
- **The Stakes**:
  - Conall wins = old guard maintains control, wealth concentrated, realm stagnates
  - Fergus wins = revitalization, genuine fae partnership (Brigid), connection to ancient magic restored
- **Timeline**: Conall's return from NYC creates urgent timeline for succession decision
- **How It's Decided**: Fae magic (the vault, prophecy, and Brigid's power) determines the true heir

### Series Character - Fergus's Ex (Book 2 Setup)
- **Name**: [TBD]
- **Description**: Beautiful leprechaun woman who expected to become queen
- **Background**: Was in relationship with Fergus, believed she would be his consort when he took the throne
- **Motivation for Freeing Conall**:
  - Feels betrayed and angry that Fergus chose Brigid instead
  - May sympathize with Conall's imprisonment, see him as unfairly treated
  - Could be motivated by revenge against Fergus/Brigid, or genuine belief Conall is better for the realm
  - Possibly manipulated by Conall himself (using his charm/amulet even from prison?)
- **Role in Book 2**: Her actions have major consequences as Conall escapes/returns as antagonist
