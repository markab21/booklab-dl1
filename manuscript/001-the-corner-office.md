# Chapter 1: The Corner Office

The problem with Conall Sinclair was that he understood power.

Not the obvious kind—the corner office forty stories above Manhattan, the tailored suits that cost more than her monthly rent, the way other men deferred to him in meetings. That was theater. Window dressing for what lay underneath: the bone-deep certainty that everything in his orbit belonged to him. Including her.

"Close the door," he said, not looking up from the documents spread across his desk.

Just those two words, and her entire nervous system betrayed her. Heat pulsed between her thighs, sharp and insistent. Her nipples tightened against her bra. After three years as his executive assistant, she should have built up immunity to his voice, to the casual command that somehow always felt intimate, dangerous, like foreplay disguised as business.

She hadn't.

Brigid closed the door. Locked it out of habit—his habit, not hers. Private meetings meant locked doors, meant she'd leave his office flushed and wound tight, aching in places she couldn't acknowledge during work hours.

The office was all glass and steel, floor-to-ceiling windows with Manhattan stretched out like his personal kingdom. From up here, everything looked small except for him. Except for the way he commanded space without moving, the way her body responded to his proximity like gravity, like inevitability.

He was still on the Bloomberg terminal, the screen painting his face electric blue, and she caught the exact moment his eyes registered the file she'd brought without being asked. The slight tightening of his jaw. His hand going still on the mouse. Conall Sinclair didn't have many tells, but she'd learned to read the microscopic ones—the ones that meant she'd anticipated him correctly. The ones that made warmth coil low in her belly, made her clit throb with memory of nights alone touching herself to fantasies she'd never admit out loud.

"Sit," he said, finally lifting his gaze to her.

Not a request. They both knew it.

She crossed the office on legs that felt vaguely unreliable, hyperaware of the floor-to-ceiling windows, of how exposed they were up here. Anyone with a telescope from the right building could watch them. The thought shouldn't have been arousing.

It was.

She pulled the chair closer—not too close, maintaining that professional distance she'd perfected over three years—but proximity to Conall Sinclair was its own animal. He commanded space the way other men commanded armies.

"The Worthington file," he said. Not a question.

"Already uploaded to the secure server. Cross-referenced the Dubai subsidiary transfers with the previous audit. The discrepancy you flagged last week?" Her voice came out steady, which was a minor miracle considering her hands were gripping the chair arms like they might save her from drowning. "I found where it went."

He leaned back, and the way he did it was calculated—giving her space but also somehow trapping her in it. His eyes were the color of strong tea, deep brown bordered by a ring of darker amber, and they tracked across her face with the precision of someone used to owning everything he looked at. Reading. Calculating. Taking inventory of exactly how affected she was, how hard her breathing had gotten, how her pulse jumped in her throat.

"You didn't email it."

"You told me you preferred I brief you on sensitive files in person."

"I did." He smiled then, slow and dangerous. "Come here."

It wasn't a request. They both knew it. She stood, legs unsteady, and moved to his side of the desk. When she leaned over to point out the file structures on his screen, the heat of him hit her first. Then the scent. Always the same: expensive cologne—something dark and woody she'd never managed to identify—coffee, and underneath it all, rain.

Rain in a sealed office forty stories in the air. It made no sense. She'd noticed it her first week working for him and had spent months trying to rationalize it. Failed every time.

"Here," she said, pointing, her voice rougher than she wanted. She cleared her throat. "The subsidiary in Dubai restructured their holding accounts three weeks ago. I traced the transfers to a shell corporation registered in the Cayman Islands—"

His hand brushed the back of her neck as he reached past her for the mouse, and oh God. Just a touch, just accidental contact with her skin above the collar of her blouse, but it sent her heart into a completely different rhythm. His breath warmed her cheek. His sleeve brushed her shoulder. Her panties were soaked, and she had to fight not to press her thighs together, not to give away how badly she wanted him to slide that hand down her spine, under her skirt, between her legs.

For one moment—just one moment—she let herself imagine turning toward him. Letting her mouth find that space where his neck met his shoulder. Tasting that inexplicable rain scent on his skin. Dropping to her knees right here and unzipping those expensive trousers, taking his cock in her mouth until he lost that iron control, until he gripped her hair and fucked her face and finally—after three years of this torturous restraint—showed her what lay beneath all that discipline.

"Do you ever want to leave this?" he asked quietly, his eyes still on the screen.

The question was so unexpected that she jerked away from him, breaking the dangerous proximity. Suddenly she could breathe again.

Sort of.

"Leave... what?"

"This." He gestured vaguely toward the desk, the office, the humming machinery of high finance surrounding them. "The numbers. The endless optimization of wealth. Do you ever wonder what else is out there?"

It wasn't a question she'd expected. Conall rarely asked personal questions, and when he did, they always had a purpose. A way of knowing if you were still committed. If you were grateful. If you belonged to him completely.

"I don't mind it," she said carefully. And it was true. She liked the precision of financial work, the satisfaction of finding the discrepancy, of solving the puzzle. But there was something in the way he was looking at her now—through his reflection in the dark screen, which was somehow more intense than a direct look—that made her suspect he wasn't asking about the work at all.

"You're wasted here," he said, and his voice had dropped into something dangerous. Something that made her think of silk sheets and bad decisions and being fucked until she couldn't remember her own name. "Answering phones. Running analysis. You're too clever for this. Too..." He paused, and his eyes found hers in the reflection for just a moment. "Too much."

The word landed like a touch. Heat flooded her face, her chest, between her legs. She stood abruptly, needing distance, needing to remember why she kept an entire office between them at all times. Needing the geometry of professional boundaries to mean something again.

"The Worthington analysis will be finished before noon," she said, proud of how steady her voice came out. "I'll email it to their team and prepare the briefing materials for Wednesday."

She walked to the door. Needed to leave. Needed to escape the orbit of him before he could ask her to stay, before she could be stupid enough to want to.

"Brigid."

She turned back. He was leaning back in his chair, completely at ease, still studying her like she was a puzzle he'd already solved.

"What if I had something more for you?"

Her pulse quickened. "More what?"

"Come to dinner Friday night. We'll talk about it then."

It wasn't an invitation. The phrasing was soft, honeyed, almost a question, but they both knew what it was: a command wrapped in cashmere. And the terrifying part—the part that kept her up late at night, hand between her legs, imagining his hands instead of her own, imagining him spreading her thighs and eating her pussy until she screamed his name—was that she wanted to say yes.

"Conall, I don't think—"

"Eight o'clock," he said, cutting her off. "The Velasquez. Wear something nice."

He dismissed her by turning back to his computer, and she was grateful for it. If he'd kept looking at her like that—like he could see straight through her professional armor to the want underneath—she might have done something catastrophically unprofessional. Like dropped to her knees right there. Like climbed into his lap and found out if that controlled exterior cracked when she rode him. Like begged him to bend her over this desk and finally, after three years, take what they both knew he wanted.

She made it back to her desk in the bullpen and immediately dove into work, using code and numbers as armor against the way her body hummed from his proximity, still aching from imagined contact.

"He already asking you to work the weekend?" Marcus from the desk beside hers whispered, eyeing her with something like sympathy.

"Dinner. Friday."

"Oh." Marcus's eyes went wide. "You're moving up, then. That's what he does. Dinner, then a 'special project,' then you're either his closest advisor or you quit because you can't take it anymore."

"There are other options," Brigid said, pulling up the Worthington analysis with more force than necessary.

"Name one."

She couldn't. Which was part of the problem. Working for Conall Sinclair was like being in the orbit of something powerful enough to pull you off course. You were either the kind of person who could handle the gravity, or you weren't. And if you weren't, you learned quickly to make yourself that way. Or you burned up on entry.

By five o'clock, she'd finished the Worthington analysis (immaculate), responded to forty-three emails, scheduled a meeting that didn't exist just so she'd have an excuse not to go to Thursday happy hour, and was reaching for her coat when a message pinged on her screen.

*A colleague will deliver a package to your apartment tomorrow evening. Review it before Friday. Confidential.*

No signature. None needed. She knew his communication style like she knew her own heartbeat.

Brigid stared at that message for a long moment, her coffee (three hours old now and definitely cold) sitting forgotten beside her. She didn't reply. Experience had taught her that sometimes the only appropriate response was no response at all.

She shut down her computer, grabbed her bag, and headed home to an apartment that suddenly felt very small and very exposed.

The city was already shifting from day to night as she took the subway downtown. Yellow cabs honked, people hurried past each other without looking, the sky turned that strange purple-gray that only happened in Manhattan in late October. Normal. Ordinary. The kind of evening that happened to thousands of people in thousands of buildings, none of them realizing they were about to make the decision that would split their life in two.

None of them realizing that tonight, when she got home to her empty apartment, she would strip off her clothes and lie on her bed and touch herself while imagining Conall's voice commanding her to come. Imagining his hands on her body, his mouth between her legs, his cock finally—after three years of this torturous professional restraint—filling her until she couldn't breathe, couldn't think, couldn't remember why she'd ever thought keeping him at arm's length was possible.

She came twice with his name on her lips, hating herself for wanting him this badly, for being unable to stop, for knowing that Friday would change everything and walking toward it anyway like a moth to flame.

Like gravity.

Like inevitability.
