---

The Velasquez occupied the top two floors of a building in Tribeca that probably had a name, though Conall would never admit to needing to know it. Brigid had never been here before—she'd passed it, seen the discretion of its unmarked entrance, understood that it was the kind of place where people did things they didn't want photographed. The kind of place where the dinner wasn't about food.

"You're nervous," Conall observed, not looking at her as he swirled his wine. She could feel his attention all the same, the weight of it like a hand at the base of her spine. "Don't be."

Easy for him to say. Conall looked like he'd been born in a Prada suit, like his natural state was this: expensive, contained, utterly in control. He'd loosened his tie—a concession to the late hour, or possibly to her. She wasn't sure which unnerved her more.

"I'm not nervous," she lied.

His smile suggested he knew exactly how nervous she was. She'd worn the dress he'd sent to her apartment three days ago—a slip of emerald silk that cost more than she usually made in a week. She'd wanted to refuse it. She'd refused it for exactly ninety minutes before putting it on. The dress was a problem. The dress meant things she wasn't ready to acknowledge.

"The project in Ireland," he said, finally turning his gaze to her. In the candlelight, his eyes were impossible to read. "I need you to go. Personal assignment. The kind that stays personal."

She'd been expecting this. She hadn't been expecting it to be phrased like a claim.

"I'm your executive assistant," she said carefully. "I'm already personal."

"Not like this."

The waiter appeared and disappeared like they were operating in a separate dimension. Brigid took a drink of her wine and understood that she wasn't going to get to leave this restaurant the same person she'd arrived as. Something about his tone said the point of this evening was to transform her into something else.

"The estate belonged to my family," Conall continued, and his voice had dropped, become something intimate. "It's being valued for sale. I need your assessment. But I also need something else."

He reached across the table. For a moment, she thought he was going to touch her hand. Instead, he reached for the wine glass that sat between them, nearly finished. His fingers brushed it, and somehow that was more intimate than anything he could have done. His knuckle grazed the rim—the place her mouth had been.

"I need," he said slowly, "you."

The way he said it wasn't an offer. It was a statement of fact, like he was describing the weather or the wine's vintage. Like her agreement was already decided, just waiting for her to catch up.

"Conall—"

"You're extraordinary," he continued, and he wasn't looking at her mouth anymore, was looking her in the eye. "Intelligent. Beautiful. Ambitious. And you want things. I've watched you watch me for three years. Don't deny it."

She didn't. The heat in her cheeks was answer enough.

"Ireland," he said. "Two weeks. You'll assess the estate. And you'll let me show you what I can offer. Not in New York where people know us. There, where we can be what we actually are instead of what we pretend to be in the office."

"Which is?"

"You know which is."

She did know. Had known for three years, had been slowly going insane from knowing. The way his hand on the small of her back lingered. The way he said her name like he was tasting it. The way he looked at her sometimes like she was a problem he'd specifically chosen to solve.

"I don't think—" she started.

"Don't think," he interrupted, and there was something almost kind in his voice. "That's been your mistake all along. You think too much. In Ireland, I'm going to show you what it feels like to stop thinking. To just want something and take it."

Her pulse was pounding. Her skin was hot. The dress was suddenly too tight, like it was designed specifically to make her aware of every inch of her body.

"Are you offering me a promotion?" she asked, and there was something close to hysteria in her laugh.

"I'm offering you the choice between safety and something real," he said. "Ireland. Two weeks. And then you come back knowing exactly what you are to me. And what I am to you."

He pulled out his phone, slid it across the table. Already open on it: confirmation for business class flights, a booking for Gleann Scáth estate, a contract for a week's consulting fee that was larger than her annual salary.

"I'm taking the liberty of assuming yes," he said. "Tell me if I'm wrong."

She looked at the phone. Looked at the flights. Looked at him.

"I'll think about it," she heard herself say, though they both knew there was no thinking involved. There was only this: the recognition that she wanted to know what it felt like to stop being careful. To take something without analyzing it to death first.

"Don't think too long," he said. "The flight leaves Friday."

Her apartment was dark and cold when she got home, and Brigid immediately undressed, leaving the expensive dress where she'd let it fall. She wasn't thinking about the appropriateness of that. She wasn't thinking about a lot of things.

She showered, though she'd only been sitting at a table. Turned the water as hot as she could stand and let it run over her skin until her fingers pruned. By the time she toweled off, she was already humming with anticipatory desire—or was that just her body's response to the evening? The proximity to Conall? The explicit nature of what he'd offered?

She got into bed naked. Let her hands wander. Let herself think about his hands instead.

This was dangerous. This was stupid. This was absolutely what she was going to do because the alternative—two more years of this tension, this waiting, this slow corrosion of her professionalism—was intolerable.

She thought about his office. About the way he'd come around behind her chair, supposedly to look at whatever was on her screen, but really just to be close enough that she could smell him. That she could feel the heat of him, the controlled power of his presence. She'd fantasized about him pressing her into her desk. About his hands on her hips. About that perfect control finally, finally breaking.

In her fantasy, it did break. In her fantasy, she stood up and turned around and his mouth was on hers before she could change her mind, and his hands were pulling her skirt up, and he was—

She pushed down her underwear with a soft gasp, her breathing already hitching. Spread her legs with a mixture of shame and hunger. Circled her clitoris, experimenting with pressure and speed, trying to find the exact configuration that would make her come.

The fantasy kept shifting, though. Because Conall was controlled, always controlled, and somehow that made it harder to imagine him losing it. Harder to imagine him doing anything that didn't seem calculated.

So her fantasy pivoted. She imagined being in Ireland. Imagined a place where the careful professional distance fell away. Where he could want her without it being a strategic move. Where she could want him back without it feeling like surrender.

She worked herself faster, her hips moving in a rhythm that felt like desperation and anticipation mixed together. The orgasm built slowly, then suddenly crested, and she came with a gasp that turned into something like a sob.

But it was unsatisfying. Left her angry. Because here's what Conall had done with his words: he'd offered her a choice between him and someone else, even though she'd never mentioned anyone else. Just the implication of it—the knowledge that there might be an alternative—made her want to prove that she chose him. That her desire was genuine, not just sexual frustration redirected onto the nearest authority figure.

She lay there in the dark afterward, her hand still between her legs, feeling the slow fade of pleasure and the creeping return of anxiety.

By morning, she'd made up her mind in that strange way you make up your mind during the hours when your rational brain is offline: the decision was already made; she was just letting her conscious mind catch up.

Packing became an act of ritualistic sexual preparation, though she wouldn't have admitted that if asked. She bought new underwear—expensive, impractical things in silk and lace that she'd never wear to work. Things that were solely for the purpose of being removed. She packed them carefully, as though they mattered.

She also packed alternatives: professional clothes, walking shoes, the kind of outfit you'd wear if you wanted to seem resistant to seduction. Just in case. Though in case of what, she wasn't entirely sure. In case she wanted to go to Ireland and *not* let Conall take exactly what he'd promised?

Her friend Maya called while she was folding jeans.

"Where are you going?" Maya demanded, because apparently when you stood in front of your closet for an hour looking like you were having an existential crisis, you should expect your best friend to notice the evidence.

"Ireland," Brigid said. "Two weeks. Work thing."

"What kind of work thing?"

The kind where her boss had explicitly told her he was going to make her come, and she'd bought expensive underwear for the occasion.

"Estate appraisal," she said.

"With who?"

"Conall."

The silence on the line was eloquent.

"You're sleeping with your boss," Maya finally said. It wasn't a question.

"I'm not—"

"You absolutely are. I can hear it in your voice. You're going to Ireland to let Conall Sinclair do whatever he wants with you, and then you're going to come back and pretend it never happened, and you're going to continue being his executive assistant like he hasn't already thoroughly assessed the executive in question."

"It's not like that," Brigid said, but she was thinking about the way he'd looked at her across that table. The way he'd said: *Take it.*

"How long?" Maya asked.

"Two weeks."

"Are you in love with him?"

"No," Brigid said immediately, and meant it. Love implied equality. This was something else entirely. This was desire and power and the specific kind of tension that could only be resolved through physical submission or victory. "It's not that complicated."

"Then what is it?"

Brigid didn't have an answer. She'd been asking herself that same question for three years. She'd been asking it during every late night at the office, every time she'd felt his eyes on her, every time she'd gone home and touched herself and thought about his hands in place of her own.

"I'll tell you after Ireland," she said. "I'll have answers by then."

"Or you'll have more questions," Maya said darkly. "Conall Sinclair doesn't answer questions. He creates them."

After she hung up, Brigid finished packing. She folded the expensive lingerie one more time, arranged it in the side pocket of her suitcase like a secret. Like a promise she was making to herself: *Yes. This is happening. You're choosing this.*

By Friday morning, she'd checked her bags twice, texted confirmation to Conall (using professional language that somehow seemed both submissive and defiant), and called a car to take her to the airport.

The driver asked if she was excited about her trip.

She said she was, and didn't mention that her hands were shaking from something other than caffeine. Didn't mention that she'd felt the weight of Conall's promise in her chest since that dinner. Didn't mention that she was about to step onto an airplane and fly toward a choice she'd already made, and she had absolutely no idea what would happen when she landed.

This was a beginning. The airport was just the marker, the threshold. The actual beginning—the one that mattered—would happen on that Irish estate, in those old stone rooms, with a man who'd promised to show her exactly who she could become when she stopped thinking.

She was ready to find out.
