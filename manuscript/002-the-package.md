# Chapter 2: The Package

The package arrived at 7:47 PM on a Thursday, twenty-four minutes earlier than expected.

Brigid knew this because she'd been refreshing the tracking app obsessively for the past eighteen hours, running through scenarios about what Conall might have sent her. Tax documents? A raise offer? Something more personal that would explain the way he'd looked at her when he said to "wear something nice"? Something that would finally, after three years of this torturous professional restraint, acknowledge the sexual tension that made every interaction feel like foreplay?

She answered the door to find a woman in a pristine gray suit standing in her building's hallway, holding a slim leather portfolio.

"Brigid?" The woman was all efficiency, the same kind that Brigid recognized from her own mirror. "This is for your review only. Mr. Sinclair asked that you read it completely before Friday dinner and bring your feedback."

"Feedback on what?"

But the woman was already handing over the portfolio and walking away, professional smile already directed at the next task.

Brigid closed the door and stood in her apartment—a studio in the East Village that cost more than she could really afford but less than she'd been willing to pay to live on her own—and stared at the leather-bound portfolio. Her heart pounded. That familiar ache pulsed between her legs that always accompanied thoughts of Conall, the persistent throb of desire she'd learned to suppress during work hours but that came roaring back the moment she was alone.

Inside, she found:

First, a property listing. Gleann Scáth. An estate in West Cork, Ireland. Forty-three acres. Stone manor, gardens, forest. "Historical significance, modern updates, requires assessment for upcoming acquisition." The photos were breathtaking—mist rolling through gardens, stone walls covered in ivy, a kind of wild beauty that looked like it belonged in a Gothic novel. A place where professional boundaries might dissolve into the Irish mist, where she could finally discover if the want she felt was real or just years of unfulfilled fantasy.

Second, a briefing document. Five pages, dense with information about the property's history, the owner, the "sensitive nature" of the acquisition. A name appeared in the corporate structure: Sinclair Holdings, Irish Estate Division. And buried in the third page, a strange notation: "Local legends regarding property's magical connection. While superstition, may affect valuation and current owner's position. Recommend professional appraisal that accounts for cultural significance."

Magical connection? Brigid read that section twice, but the language remained deliberately vague, dressed up in corporate speak that made the absurd sound almost reasonable.

Third, a letter. On Sinclair Banking letterhead, in Conall's handwriting—precise, controlled, every letter perfectly formed:

*Brigid,*

*This is the "special project" I mentioned. An estate in Ireland that requires a specialist appraisal. The current owner is... complicated. Family, which makes this delicate. My nephew has managed the property for years while I've built the banking business. We had an agreement—he stays in Ireland, manages the estate, and the family wealth stays compartmentalized.*

*That arrangement is ending.*

*He won't cooperate with standard corporate evaluation teams. You're to assess the property on behalf of Sinclair Holdings for a potential acquisition. Your position would be promoted from executive assistant to Junior Estate Appraiser. Expenses covered. Temporary assignment—three to four weeks estimated, possibly longer depending on what you find.*

*The salary increase is reflected in the attached offer letter.*

*I won't lie to you—my nephew is difficult to work with. Charming when he wants to be, impossible otherwise. He's agreed to cooperate with an external appraiser, though I suspect that's more curiosity on his part than genuine interest in selling. Either way, this is your opportunity to prove you're ready for more than answering my phone.*

*I'm coming to Cork myself next week for formal acquisition meetings with his legal team. I thought it beneficial if you arrived first, completed your initial assessment, and reported your findings to me directly. It will be valuable experience.*

*This is confidential. Don't discuss it with anyone.*

*One more thing: He doesn't know you work for me. He knows only that you're an independent appraiser hired by Sinclair Holdings. I need someone I trust to give me an unbiased assessment of both the property and his financial position. His lawyers are circling, and I need leverage.*

*Say yes to the project. Be ready to leave Monday. I'll arrange everything. You'll stay at the estate, have full access to the property and his financial records. It's straightforward work.*

*And Brigid—dress warmly. Ireland is cold. And wet. Though I imagine you'll find other ways to stay warm.*

*Friday at eight. The Velasquez. We'll discuss the details.*

*—C*

Brigid sat on her bed and read the letter three more times.

A promotion. An assignment abroad. Working directly with him in Ireland. Away from the office, away from the careful boundaries they'd maintained for three years.

The last line made her skin flush hot. "Other ways to stay warm." Jesus. He wasn't even trying to be subtle anymore.

She should have said no immediately. That's what a rational person would do. She should have called him, or emailed, or found him first thing Friday morning and politely declined. This made no sense—three weeks away from the office, traveling to a place where she'd never been, working for a man who gave her the kind of attraction that made her question her own judgment. A man who was clearly done pretending this was just professional.

Instead, she found herself opening the attached offer letter.

The salary increase was substantial. Not life-changing, but enough to put a real dent in her student loans. Enough to make her a real appraiser instead of an assistant who analyzed property values in her spare time. Enough to matter.

But it wasn't just the money. It was the thought of three weeks in Ireland with Conall, away from the prying eyes of the office, where the professional boundaries that had kept them apart could finally dissolve. Where she could find out if the sexual tension she'd been imagining was real, if he wanted her as badly as she wanted him.

The letter made it clear: this was business. But that last line promised something else entirely.

She read the documents until midnight, made notes in the margins of the briefing (mostly questions: Why the oblique reference to magic? What was the "complicated" family history? What kind of man was this nephew?), and finally fell asleep on top of the papers.

By Friday morning, she'd convinced herself this was an opportunity. A real one. Not a trap. Not some elaborate scheme to get her alone in Ireland where she couldn't easily escape if things between them became... complicated.

She dressed carefully for dinner. A black dress—elegant but with a neckline that suggested rather than revealed—with heeled boots and a coat that made her look both professional and expensive. She wanted to look like someone who could handle a promotion. Like someone he could trust.

But she also wanted to look like someone he desired. Someone he couldn't resist. Someone who was finally ready to acknowledge that three years of careful professional distance had been slowly killing them both.

The Velasquez was in Tribeca, all exposed brick and wine that cost more than her entire outfit, with a reservation list you couldn't buy your way onto. Conall was already seated when she arrived, at a corner table that offered privacy and a view of the entire restaurant.

He stood when she approached—never let it be said that he wasn't a gentleman—and for a moment, before he arranged his features into that controlled expression, she saw him clearly. Saw the way his gaze traveled from her face down to her boots and back up, slow and deliberate and hungry. Saw his jaw tighten. Saw his hand flex once before he mastered himself.

Then he smiled, and everything shifted.

"You read the materials," he said. Not a question. He pulled out her chair, a gesture that should have felt courteous but somehow felt possessive—his hand brushing her shoulder as she sat, his body close enough that she caught the scent of him. Expensive cologne and something darker underneath. "What do you think?"

"I think," she said, settling into her seat, "that you're asking me to spy on your own family. Under the guise of property assessment."

His smile widened. "Good. You're thinking clearly. That's why I want you on this."

"That's not—"

The server appeared, pouring wine, and Conall ordered for both of them without asking. She hated that he did that. Hated that part of her liked it, the way he took control without asking, the way he assumed he knew what she wanted.

Once they were alone again, he picked up his wine glass, studied it like it was a document. "The property is valuable. Not just financially. It's old money, family money. My nephew has been managing it while I built the banking business. We had an agreement—he stays in Ireland, the family wealth stays separate."

"And?"

"And he's made certain decisions that affect the family's broader interests." His fingers traced the stem of the wine glass, slow and deliberate, and she found herself watching the movement. Imagining those fingers on her skin. "I need to understand the full scope of what's happening there. Financial records, the property's condition, his activities. Everything."

It was unethical. It was exactly the kind of thing that should make her stand up and walk out.

Instead, she heard herself ask: "And if he finds out I'm reporting to you?"

"He won't. You're an independent appraiser. Professional. You file reports to Sinclair Holdings, which is separate from Sinclair Banking." He leaned forward slightly, and the space between them felt charged. "As far as he's concerned, you're there for the acquisition. Nothing more."

She should have asked why his nephew would agree to that. She should have questioned the entire premise.

But instead, she was calculating: Three weeks in Ireland. A promotion. New experience. And when she came back? She'd be closer to Conall, more indispensable, possibly moving out of the assistant track and into something that meant real advancement.

And maybe—probably—she'd finally find out if the sexual tension that had been simmering for three years would ignite.

"One condition," she said.

"Yes?"

"I get editorial control over my report. I won't falsify findings."

He was quiet for a moment, and she watched him—this careful, controlled man who always had a plan. Watched him actually consider whether she might say no, whether this might not go according to his design.

"Agreed," he said finally. "That's actually why I chose you. You're one of the few people in my life who won't just tell me what I want to hear." He paused, and something flickered in his expression. "Though I'll admit, there are some things I very much want to hear you say."

Heat flooded her face. Her pulse kicked up. That wasn't professional. That wasn't even subtle.

"Conall—"

"Relax," he said, but his eyes were dark and intense. "I'm not going to seduce you over dinner. Though I'll admit the thought has crossed my mind. Multiple times. Tonight alone."

The server returned with their first course, and Brigid used the interruption to catch her breath, to remember that they were in public, that this was still technically a business meeting about a job opportunity.

But when the server left, Conall didn't return to business.

"You should know something before you go to Ireland," he said, his voice lower now, intimate. "Before everything changes." His hand found hers on the table, warm and deliberate, his thumb tracing a small circle on the back of her hand that sent heat straight between her legs. "This assignment isn't just about the property."

Her heart stopped. She was quite sure. Medically certain that she could die right now and the autopsy would find nothing at all.

"Conall—"

"I'm going to court you," he said simply, like he was discussing market trends instead of completely unraveling her carefully organized life. "You should know that. When you're in Ireland, when you've had distance to think clearly, I'm going to pursue this. You and me. Whatever this is that's been building for three years."

He squeezed her hand gently, then released her, reaching for his wine as if he hadn't just detonated a bomb in the middle of the restaurant.

"But first, you're going to Ireland. You're going to do this job. For me. For yourself. And then we'll see where we are."

She couldn't form words. The concept of language seemed suddenly foreign.

"I've wanted you since the second week you started working for me," he continued, his gaze holding hers with unnerving intensity. "The Worthington analysis. You stayed late, brought me the files yourself instead of emailing. You were wearing that blue dress, the one with the buttons down the front, and I spent the entire meeting imagining undoing every single one of them."

She should stop him. Should redirect this back to business. Should do anything except sit there with heat pooling low in her belly and her panties getting wetter with every word.

"I've been patient," he said, leaning forward. "Professional. Appropriate. Because you deserved that—deserved to work for me without dodging advances, deserved to build your career on merit, not on how badly I wanted to bend you over my desk and find out if you taste as good as you smell."

"Jesus Christ." The words escaped before she could stop them.

His smile was slow and dangerous. "But you're not my assistant anymore. Not after this. You're taking this job, you're going to Ireland, and when you come back?" He picked up his fork, cut into his salmon with perfect precision. "When you come back, we're going to finish this conversation. Properly. In private."

The rest of dinner was excruciating. He told her about Ireland, about the estate, about what to expect. He asked her questions and actually listened to her answers, gave her his complete attention in a way that made the entire restaurant disappear.

But underneath every word, every look, every casual touch as he poured more wine, was the promise. The inevitability.

When the waiter brought the check, Conall leaned back in his chair, studying her with that intense gaze that made her feel naked despite being fully clothed.

"I should tell you one more thing about my nephew," he said, his voice measured but with an edge she couldn't quite place. "He's charming. Women find him irresistible—he's got that wild, untamed appeal that makes them forget to be smart." His hand found hers again across the table, possessive and warm. "But you're smarter than that. Aren't you, Brigid?"

It should have sounded like a question. It sounded like a warning.

"I can handle your nephew," she said, pulling her hand back, needing the distance.

"Can you?" He signaled for the server, handed over his card without looking at the bill. "That's what I'm counting on."

They walked outside into the October night, and he hailed her a cab with the effortless authority of someone used to getting exactly what he wanted.

Before she got in, he caught her hand one last time, pulled her close enough that she could feel the heat of him through his suit.

"Three weeks," he murmured against her ear. "Do the job. Think about what I said. And Brigid?" His lips brushed her temple, barely a touch, but it sent electricity down her spine. "When you're alone in that big manor house, when you're lying in bed at night... I want you to think about this. About me. About what's waiting when you come home."

He released her, stepped back, and she climbed into the cab on legs that felt vaguely unreliable.

As the car pulled away, she caught sight of him in the side mirror—standing on the sidewalk, hands in his pockets, watching her leave. In control. Patient. Predatory.

When she got back to her apartment, she stripped off her dress with shaking hands, climbed into bed, and did exactly what he'd told her to do.

She thought about him. About his hands on her skin, his voice commanding her to spread her legs, his mouth on her. She touched herself and imagined it was him—his fingers inside her, his teeth on her neck, his cock filling her until she couldn't breathe.

When she came, it was his name on her lips, and she hated herself for wanting him this badly, for saying yes to Ireland, for walking straight into whatever trap he'd laid.

But she'd done it anyway.

Monday morning, she'd get on a plane. She'd go to this estate in Ireland, meet this mysterious nephew, do the job.

And when she came back? God help her, she was going to let Conall Sinclair ruin her in every possible way.
