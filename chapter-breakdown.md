## Notes & Reminders

**Key Worldbuilding Consistency Checks**:
- Conall wears amulet always (under shirt until discovered)
- Fergus manages the estate, connected to land
- Vault requires Brigid's magic to open
- Magic gradually reveals itself through Act I
- Masturbation scenes drive unconscious manifestation
- The Field is crucial for power awakening
- Small fae love Brigid immediately

**Character Voice Reminders**:
- Conall: Formal, controlled, rarely uses contractions
- Fergus: Casual, Irish phrases (a ghrÃ¡), direct and honest
- Brigid: Professional mode vs. real self mode

**Romance Balance**:
- Conall: Powerful sexual energy but too much/forced
- Fergus: Building meaningful desire, genuine connection
- Physical progression with Fergus is gradual until Field
- Her fantasies during masturbation shape reality

**Magic Rules**:
- Tied to emotion and desire
- Manifests through pleasure and strong feelings
- Gradual revelation throughout Act I and II
- Full awakening through sexual union with true love
