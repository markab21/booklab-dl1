# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This project is focused on transforming a book idea into a complete novel through a structured waterfall progression system. The goal is to create schema and tools to facilitate this creative development process.

## MCP Configuration

The project uses the Context7 MCP server (configured in `.mcp.json`) for enhanced context capabilities.

## Skill Development Workflow

### 1. Understanding Skills Structure

Skills are located in `.claude/skills/` directory. Each skill is a specialized knowledge module for specific aspects of novel development.

**Path Structure**: `.claude/skills/<skill-folder>/SKILL.md`

**Available Skills:**
- **character-voice-and-arc** (`.claude/skills/character-voice-and-arc/SKILL.md`): Character development, voice consistency, and emotional arc tracking
- **leprechaun-realm-worldbuilding** (`.claude/skills/leprechaun-realm-worldbuilding/SKILL.md`): Fantasy world construction and magical systems
- **romantasy-plot-brainstorming** (`.claude/skills/romantasy-plot-brainstorming/SKILL.md`): Plot development for romantic fantasy
- **romantasy-prose-style** (`.claude/skills/romantasy-prose-style/SKILL.md`): Writing style guidelines and prose techniques
- **romantasy-scene-builder** (`.claude/skills/romantasy-scene-builder/SKILL.md`): Scene construction framework with dialogue and pacing

Each `SKILL.md` file contains:
- Metadata (YAML frontmatter with name and description)
- Comprehensive guidelines and frameworks
- Examples and templates
- Checklists and validation criteria

### 2. Skill Development Process

When developing or extending skills, follow this workflow:

#### A. Initial Assessment
1. Use `tree .claude -a` to see existing skills structure
2. Read the current skill file to understand existing content
3. Create a todo list to track development tasks
4. Identify gaps or areas for expansion

#### B. Content Development Strategy
1. **Start with Structure**: Outline major sections before writing
2. **Layer Complexity**: Begin with core concepts, add depth progressively
3. **Include Examples**: Every concept should have concrete examples
4. **Provide Templates**: Give actionable frameworks users can apply
5. **Add Checklists**: Include validation criteria for quality control

#### C. Iterative Enhancement Pattern
```
1. Review existing content
2. Identify next logical section
3. Add comprehensive content with:
   - Theoretical framework
   - Practical application
   - Examples from the story context
   - Do's and don'ts
   - Templates or formulas
4. Ensure consistency with other sections
5. Update any cross-references
```

### 3. Ideation and Expansion Guidelines

When ideating on skills:

#### Content Types to Include
- **Frameworks**: Structured approaches to tackle specific challenges
- **Techniques**: Specific methods with step-by-step instructions
- **Examples**: Multiple examples showing different applications
- **Templates**: Fill-in-the-blank structures for common scenarios
- **Checklists**: Validation points to ensure quality
- **Common Mistakes**: What to avoid and why
- **Advanced Techniques**: Progressive complexity for mastery

#### Section Development Order
1. **Core Concepts**: Fundamental principles
2. **Application Methods**: How to use the concepts
3. **Examples & Templates**: Concrete implementations
4. **Edge Cases & Variations**: Handling special scenarios
5. **Quality Checks**: Validation and refinement

### 4. Best Practices for Skill Updates

#### Do's:
- ‚úÖ Maintain consistent formatting and structure
- ‚úÖ Use clear headers and subheaders for navigation
- ‚úÖ Include both theory and practical application
- ‚úÖ Provide multiple examples for complex concepts
- ‚úÖ Add cross-references between related sections
- ‚úÖ Use formatting (bold, italics, code blocks) for clarity
- ‚úÖ Include emotional and sensory details in examples
- ‚úÖ Track progress with TodoWrite tool

#### Don'ts:
- ‚ùå Don't add content without examples
- ‚ùå Don't create sections without practical application
- ‚ùå Don't duplicate content across skills unnecessarily
- ‚ùå Don't forget to maintain the YAML metadata
- ‚ùå Don't add complexity without foundation

### 5. Quality Assurance

Before finalizing skill updates:
1. **Completeness**: Does each section have theory, practice, and examples?
2. **Consistency**: Does new content align with existing material?
3. **Clarity**: Can someone apply this immediately?
4. **Context**: Do examples fit the romantasy leprechaun narrative?
5. **Progression**: Does content build logically from simple to complex?
